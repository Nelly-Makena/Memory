            <h1 class="main-heading">The Impact of Emotions on Memory</h1>
            <p class="lead text-center">The connection between **emotion** and **memory** influences how we store and recall experiences. This page explores how emotions shape our memories and affect the recall process in both positive and negative ways.</p>

            <!-- Emotional Enhancement of Memory -->
            <div class="memory-type">
                <h2 class="section-heading">Emotional Enhancement of Memory</h2>
                <p>When emotions are involved, memory tends to become more vivid. The **amygdala**, the brain's emotional center, strengthens the encoding of emotional memories. This is why people tend to remember significant emotional events with high clarity, whether joyful or tragic. Intense emotional experiences have a higher chance of being retained in **long-term memory**, with vivid recollections being part of the long-lasting storage.</p>

            <!-- Neuroscience of Emotion and Memory -->
            <div class="memory-type">
                <h2 class="section-heading">The Neuroscience of Emotion and Memory</h2>
                <p>The **hippocampus** and **amygdala** collaborate to encode emotional memories. When we experience strong emotions, the amygdala signals the hippocampus to prioritize and retain these memories. Chronic stress, however, can damage the hippocampus, impairing memory formation and retrieval. Stress hormones like cortisol can enhance memory for short-term emotional events but may harm long-term cognitive health if stress becomes prolonged.</p>

            <div class="memory-type">
                <h2 class="section-heading">Negative Emotions and Memory Impairment</h2>
                <p>High levels of stress and anxiety have been shown to impair memory. Prolonged exposure to stressors releases cortisol, which can damage the hippocampus. This leads to difficulties in recalling new information. Additionally, traumatic experiences can distort memories, resulting in fragmented or distorted recollections. This may manifest as **dissociative amnesia**, where a person has trouble recalling details of traumatic events.</p>

            <!-- Mood Congruence -->
            <div class="memory-type">
                <h2 class="section-heading">Mood Congruence</h2>
                <p>Mood congruence refers to the tendency to recall memories that match our current emotional state. For example, people who are happy tend to remember happy events, while those who are sad may remember painful experiences. This emotional bias can influence how we perceive past events and affect our emotional wellbeing.</p>
                <p>This phenomenon also affects decision-making and judgment, reinforcing the connection between mood and perception of reality.</p>

            <div class="memory-type">
                <h2 class="section-heading">Utilizations in Education and Therapy</h2>
                <p>Understanding how emotion affects memory is vital in therapeutic contexts. **Trauma-focused therapy** helps individuals process emotional memories that are linked to traumatic experiences. On the other hand, in education, emotional engagement can improve memory retention. Emotionally connected students tend to remember information better, making emotional involvement a powerful tool in both therapy and education.</p>
